Examples
========

The examples in this gallery demonstrate  the functionality of the ``xugrid``
package. Every example can be downloaded as either a Python script or a Jupyter
notebook for interactive exploration.

    <div class="sphx-glr-thumbcontainer" tooltip="The labels that are present in xarray&#x27;s data structures allow for easy creation of informative plots: think of dates on the x-axis, or geospatial coordinates. Xarray provides a convenient way of plotting your data provided it is structured. Xugrid extends these plotting methods to easily make spatial (x-y) plots of unstructured grids.">

    <div class="sphx-glr-thumbcontainer" tooltip="The overlap regridder works in two stages. First, it searches the source grid for all faces of the target grid, computes the intersections, and stores all overlaps between source and target faces. This occurs when the regridder is initialized. Second, the regridder applies the weights: it reduces the collection of overlapping faces to a single value for the target face.">

    <div class="sphx-glr-thumbcontainer" tooltip="A fundamental difference between structured and unstructured grids lies in the connectivity. This is true for cell to cell connectivity, but also for vertex (node) connectivity (which set of vertices make up an individual cell). In structured grids, connectivity is implicit and can be directly derived from row and column numbers; unstructured grids require explicit connectivity lists.">

    <div class="sphx-glr-thumbcontainer" tooltip="Xarray has flexible tools for label based selection, in the form of .sel and .isel for index selection. This works well for structured data since the orthogonality of the x and y axes is reflected in the axes of the underlying arrays. This orthogonality does not exist for unstructured grids, as the data for all faces cannot be stored in a two-dimensional array and is stored in a one-dimensional array instead.">
