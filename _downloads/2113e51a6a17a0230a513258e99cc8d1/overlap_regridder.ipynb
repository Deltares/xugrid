        "\n# OverlapRegridder\n\nThe overlap regridder works in two stages. First, it searches the source grid\nfor all faces of the target grid, computes the intersections, and stores all\noverlaps between source and target faces. This occurs when the regridder is\ninitialized. Second, the regridder applies the weights: it reduces the\ncollection of overlapping faces to a single value for the target face.\n\nThere are many reductions possible. The best choice generally differs based on\nthe physical meaning of the variable, or the application. Xugrid provides a\nnumber of reductions, but it's also possible to use a custom reduction\nfunction. This is demonstrated here.\n\nWe start with the same example as in the quick overview.\n"
